(Could do, not in first attempt)

Good question; learnt when a recursive solution is a better way to in LinkedList problems. Always try to think of recursive solutions if an iterative solutions doesn't seem to be the natural way to go or consists of many edge cases (even after using dummyhead, etc)
​
Edit: Iterative solution was simple enough as well.
